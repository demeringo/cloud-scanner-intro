# Introduction

This short presentation aims at explaining the _why_ behind the creation of [Boavizta cloud-scanner](https://github.com/Boavizta/cloud-scanner).

This project started out of a Boavizta hackathon, initially as a way to demonstrate that we could make good use of Boavizta Open data and Open methodology to help assess environmental impacts of public cloud usage.

Cloud scanner evolved as a open source project, part of the Boavizta ecosystem. It offers a way to address some of the challenges we identified with de default environmental reporting of most public cloud providers.

We will first explain why we are not satisfied with the status-quo, then explain the Boavizta/cloud-scanner approach.

We will also highlight the limits of our approach and the roadmap of future cloud-scanner.

This presentation addresses the _why_. But if your are more interested by the _how_ feel free to jump directly into [cloud-scanner documentation](https://boavizta.github.io/cloud-scanner/).
