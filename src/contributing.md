# Contributing

Evaluating the environmental impacts of public cloud resources is a work in progress. And we know that this this project is only a first step towards a better use of the resources.

We are convinced that this long term goal involves a multidisciplinary approach and open discussions. [Boavizta](https://boavizta.org/) projects are open source, and only possible because we share our struggles or progress and ideas.
