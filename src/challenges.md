# Challenges with cloud providers

## Lack of transparency

- Questionnable methodology (not transparent / not documented)
- Scope (1 and 2 only ?)
- Decried **Market-based** approach ðŸ’£

## Granularity problem

- in time (3 months delay)
- in service (hard to break down by app or micro service)

## Integration

- not easy to reuse a data

- cf AWS dashboard.
