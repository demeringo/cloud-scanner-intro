# Challenges with cloud providers

We face several challenges with the default environmental reporting of public cloud providers.

## A lack of transparency

- Questionnable methodology (not transparent / not documented)
- Scope (1 and 2 only ?)
- Decried **Market-based** approach ðŸ’£

## A granularity problem

- in time (3 months delay)
- in service (hard to break down by app or micro service)

## No easy integration

- difficult to reuse data
- e.g. AWS dashboard
