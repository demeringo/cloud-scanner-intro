# Roadmap

## More services

A first objective is to increase the scope of the services.

- Object storage / S3
- FAAS/Serverless (like AWS lambda or Azure functions)
- Additional managed services (like DB as a service)
- impacts of GPUs, which is key to assess AI/ML workload(!)

For each new service, this will likely be a 2 step process:

1. Define a common model (identify key drivers of the impacts) and implement this model in Boavizta API.
2. Automate collection of related data in cloud scanner.

## Support additional providers

- Azure (work in progress)
- Scaleway (work in progress)
- OVH
- ...

## Providing recommendations

Estimating environmental impacts only makes sense if we can use the results to regain the ability to avoid unnecessary impacts. 

In the future cloud-scanner or another project may provide insights on what is wasted and were to apply efforts of reduction.
