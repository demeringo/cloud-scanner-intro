# Roadmap

## More services

Increase the scope of the services.

- Object storage / S3
- FAAS/Serverless (like AWS lambda or Azure functions)
- Additional managed services (like DB as a service)
- impacts of GPUs, which is key to assess AI/ML workload(!)

## Additional providers

- Azure
- Scaleway
- ...

## Recommendations

Estimating environmental impacts only makes sense if we can use the results to regain the ability to avoid unnecessary impacts. In the future cloud-scanner or another project may provide insights on what is wasted and were to apply efforts of reduction.
