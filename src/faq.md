# Frequently asked questions

## Isn't the reporting offered by cloud provider sufficient ?

For several reasons (scope, transparency, granularity), we consider that today's reporting of major public cloud provider does not fully answers to our needs. See [Challenges](challenges.md) and [What we need](What_we_need.md).

A comparison of what is reported by default is addressed with more detail in this Boavizta article:  [Understanding the results of cloud providers' carbon calculators | Boavizta](https://boavizta.org/en/blog/calculettes-carbone-clouds-providers).

You may also refer to the academic paper that describes the Boavizta cloud methodology: [BoaviztAPI: a bottom-up model to assess the environmental impacts of cloud services](https://hal-lara.archives-ouvertes.fr/IMT-BS/hal-04621947v1).
