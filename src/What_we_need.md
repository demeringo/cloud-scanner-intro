# What we need

To assess *environmental impacts* of *public cloud* resources, we need:

## A global view of the environmental cost

- Aggregated impact data
- Use phase + manufacture phase
- Multiple criteria (GWP, ADP...)

## Real time monitoring

- *greenops* approach
- notification / alerting
- trigger other processes

## Challenge alternative architectures

- Need to simulate variant of cloud architectures
